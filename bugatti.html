                            <h3>BUGATTI</h3>
    <p>It was on one of the first pages: “bugatti”. It sounded great, was easy to remember and definitely Italian. Once the brand name had been officially registered on 26 May 1978, bugatti started to create and produce its first five coat designs. Success soon followed. In 1981, bugatti presented a line of quilted coats. It was so successful that it ensured the brand a firm place in the fashion business. This was only the start. More collections followed. The brand strengthened its market position further with its jackets. The range is steadily increased by granting licenses to expert partners.  bugatti keeps on growing. With the launch of its own suit jacket / suit collection, bugatti proved its business wear expertise. By now, bugatti not only sells trousers, knitwear / wovens and shirts but also women’s wear. The brand has become a statement, represents a lifestyle. European. Cosmopolitan

Especially in the fashion world, personal style makes all the difference. bugatti is no exception. The Brinkmanns are the second and third generation of the family to run the business. The corporate culture is shaped by their long-term commitment as the company founders and owners, and the driving force behind it. It is a culture that relies on continuity and independence. The behaviour towards employees, suppliers and business partners is characterised by a feeling of solidarity.
