                            <h3>CAPE UNION</h3>
    <p>In 1933, the late Philip Krawitz opened a store on the corner of Corporation and Mostert streets in Cape Town. It catered primarily for army troops, the navy and passing fishermen. However, Philip soon realised that he had to offer his clientele something special. He focused on building unique relationships with his customers to identify their needs, and Cape Union Mart became affectionately known as "the friendly store". Arthur J. Krawitz succeeded his father in the post-war years and the store prospered by selling summer clothing to South Africans travelling overseas in winter, and vice versa. In 1970, Philip J. Krawitz - Current Executive Chairman of the Board - followed in the footsteps of his father and grandfather. Under his leadership, the Cape Union Mart Group today is the custodian of multiple brands and chains, with more than three-hundred stores across South Africa, Namibia and Botswana. His daughters, Martine and Amanda, work for the company and continue to build on our vision: To be a world-class retailer trusted for its family values and passion to improve lives.

Our team is just as passionate about making the most of time spent outside as you are. Several staff members have climbed Everest, summited Kilimanjaro and camped in the Cederberg. When it comes to outdoor pursuits and exploring South Africa and beyond, we want to make sure you're armed with the best advice and the tools for the job. Our highly skilled staff are there to answer your questions and ensure you have the right gear for any adventure.
