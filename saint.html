                            <h3>SAINT</h3>
    <p>Guided by head chef, David Higgs and trained by the best in Milan, our chefs bring their knowledge and skill to ﬁre-top and perfectly hand-made pizza from scratch, using imported wood-ﬁre ovens from Naples.

“Through seasoning we reach simplicity. Through sweetening we spice. We have made Italian our way. Crazy, beautiful and true to us. Because, one man’s virtue is really just another man’s sin.”Good and bad, right and wrong, pure and depraved.

The one heart, dark as night, beats with a relentless syncopation ravenous for passion and seduction. It hungers for likes, double takes, the ﬂash of the camera, being wanted, becoming famous.

In the other, ebbs a cadence, slowly, gently pining for the pure, the safe, for all that’s good and right. It shines in absence, ﬂourishes as a wallﬂower, overjoyed at being overlooked.

So, when you wonder which one will win the ﬁght for your soul today, know that it all depends which one you feed tonight.

Saint is the culinary duel of our inner conﬂict, incarnate. The push and pull of light and dark. Good and bad. The tussle between yes and no, now and never.

The decadent mingling dangerously the divine
